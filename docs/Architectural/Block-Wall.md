The following are my observations having been through the process of installing a block wall.

# Block Wall Proposed Document Changes

The first document presented to the home owner starts with the "Chateau De Vie VI Homeowners Association Architectural Request Form."  This form asks for information that we already have.  Block wall projects have already been approved, and we can do a better job guiding home owners to success throughout the project.

So what do we actually need from the homeowner?

## What Information Do We Need From the Owner

We need to know:

1. Which unit is upgrading.
1. When their proposed start date is.
1. How long it's going to take.

That's about it.

Once this information is made known to the ARC / Board of Directors through the management company, the home-owner should receive a welcome packet describing all of the details of the project.  








# Block Wall Project Guidelines and Basic Instructions

## Introduction

Congratulations on your decision to replace your existing wooden slat fence with a new block wall.  The following information should provide you with everything you need to better understand every step required.

There are a few things you need to know prior to starting your project:

1. This is an architectural modification.  The board has already approved specific standards regarding each block wall and gate installation which must be followed in order to maintain a consistent appearance throughout Chateau de Vie Six.  Any deviations from the approved standards will need to be remedied at the expense of the home owner.

1. The cost of this project, is solely the responsibility of the home owner.  That includes all contractor expenses, permits, and initial paint.

1. Once the wooden fence and gate are replaced with block wall, maintenance of the new block wall and gate will be the home owner's responsibility, however, the HOA will include the block wall as a part of any future community painting projects.

1. The Chateau De Vie Architectural Committee must be notified of your intent to proceed with this project before you begin work.  This is to ensure that we avoid any scheduling conflicts with other community projects that may interfere with your block wall installation.  Upon receiving approval from the Architectural Committee, and obtaining a City of Scottsdale building permit, work may begin.

1. A Building Permit must be obtained from the City of Scottsdale _prior to notifying the board_ of your plans to upgrade your wall.
