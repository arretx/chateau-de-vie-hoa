!!! Note
    Apparently there is an additional amendment to section 1 which is supposedly dated some time in 1991.  I am unable to locate this document in public records.  It appears to be loosely tied to <a href="http://localhost:8000/hoa/Articles%20of%20Incorporation/article-10/" target="_blank">Article X</a> of the Articles of Incorporation.  I suspect it has been recorded with the wrong indexing information, making it nearly impossible to find.
