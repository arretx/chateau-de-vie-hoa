Welcome to an unofficial Chateau De Vie VI Subdivision Resource.  

!!! note "Online Messaging System"
    ![Image](media/discord.png){ width=100, align=left }  
    Discord is a very popular community messaging system that can help us stay in touch more often and engage with the community.  With private and public channels, there is a place for everyone in the association to be able to have a voice.

    <a href="https://discord.gg/UQjB6zhhdy" target="_blank">Click here to connect.</a>

## Documents

The four primary documents that govern the Association have been re-typed into a format that's easily searchable from the search field at the top of the site.  They are:

  * [Articles of Incorporation](Governing-Documents/Articles-of-Incorporation/01-Introduction.md)
  * [Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions](Governing-Documents/Declaration-of-Covenants-Conditions-and-Restrictions/00intro.md)
  * [Bylaws](Governing-Documents/Bylaws/Article-1.md)
  * [Rules and Regulations](Governing-Documents/Rules-and-Regulations/Original-Document/section-01.md)

!!! note
    With the exception of the Rules and Regulations, all other documents are public record and can be found at the Maricopa.gov website using the <a href="https://recorder.maricopa.gov/recdocdata/" target="_blank">Recorded Document Search</a>.

In addition to these documents, various other materials can be published here that are helpful to the community.
