# Read This First

## Introduction

Welcome!  This site was created by Jon and Melanie Griffith, long time residents of Chateau De Vie Six and members of the Association.  We've taken the time to create this site on our free time and at our expense to provide a more interactive experience when researching the documents that govern the Chateau De Vie Six Homeowner's Association.  Most of the original documents are very old and difficult to read, and thus, needed to be ushered into the 21st century.  As they are in PDF format and haven't been converted to text, they are not searchable through the [county recorder's office](https://recorder.maricopa.gov/recdocdata/).

We have solved that problem with this site.  Now you can quickly navigate through the CC&R's, Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, and any other pages that we create here.

Search using the Search Box in the upper right-hand corner.

!!! note
    Minor edits were needed in order to fit modern publishing techniques, but none of the original text has been modified.  Some of the original text has been omitted as it is not pertinent to the context, and since the originals are available for download from both the Maricopa County Recorder's office and the Ogden portal, there's no reason to duplicate that information here.

## Join the Conversation

Some of the pages on this site allow you to leave comments.  In order to comment, you need to login using your Github account.  If you don't have a Github account, it is free.  Simply head over to [Github.com](https://github.com) and create one.

## Documents

There are four documents that I am aware of that govern the Association beyond the superceding authority which is the City of Scottsdale, AZ.  They are:

  * Articls of Incorporation
  * Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions
  * Bylaws
  * Rules and Regulations

!!! note
    All of these documents are public record and can be found at the Maricopa.gov website using the [Recorded Document Search](https://recorder.maricopa.gov/recdocdata/)
