# SECTION VIII: CAR & OTHER VEHICLE PARKING
Carports are for vehicles of residents and/or their guests. Vehicles should not be parked in such a manner as to impede, block or prevent ready access to any other Unit to which the vehicle does not belong. Do not park in the carports or block the shed of neighboring units without permission. No parking is allowed at the end of roadways, alleys, or drive portions of the common roadways. No parking in Fire Zones. Guest parking is available near the clubhouse, but this is not a vehicle storage area. No boats, trailers, trucks, ATV vehicles or campers may be parked for more than 24 hours and may use only one space. No motorized vehicles of any kind are allowed on the sidewalks or grass areas. Workmenâ€™s trucks are exempt from rules if performing business or repairs. Bicycles are only allowed on the roadways. No loud or unreasonable noise which disturbs the peace is allowable from any vehicle. Failure to obey vehicle rules will result in a fine without warning or towing upon proper notice. A random towing contract is in play for the no parking zones.
