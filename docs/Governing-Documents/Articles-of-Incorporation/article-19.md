# Article XIX: Dissolution
The Association may be dissolved with the assent given in writing and signed by not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the entire Class A membership and two-thirds (2/3) of the entire Class B membership, if any. Upon dissolution of the Association, the assets, both real and personal, of the Association shall be dedicated to an appropriate public agency to be devoted to purposes as nearly as practicable the same as those to which they were required to be devoted by the Association.  In the event that such dedication is refused acceptance, such assets shall be granted, conveyed and assigned to any non-profit corporation, association, trust or other organization to be devoted to purposes and uses that would most nearly reflect the purposes and uses to which they were required to be devoted by the Association.
