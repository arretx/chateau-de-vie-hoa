# ARTICLE IV: PROPERTY RIGHTS, RIGHTS OF ENJOYMENT

## Section 1. Use and Enjoyment
Each owner shall be entitled to the use and enjoyment of the common area and facilities as provided in the Declaration. Any owner may delegate his rights of enjoyment of the common area and facilities to the members of his family, his tenants or contract purchasers, who reside on the property. Such owner shall notify the secretary in writing of the name of any such delegee. The rights and privileges of such delegee are subject to suspension to the same extent as those of the owner.

## Section 2. Reasonable Fees
Irrespective of the fact that Section 1 (a) of Article II of the Declaration gives the Association the right to charge reasonable admission and other fees for the use of any recreational facilities situated upon the common area, this right shall not be exercised as to members for a period of five (5) years from the date of recordation of the Declaration, and after this period, only upon written approval of two-thirds (â…”) of the entire Class A membership.
