## Motions

I've observed very quick decisions regarding issues at hand.  It feels like motions are created on the fly without ample thought to all of the potentials angles of the resolution, leading to a lag in implementation, or confusion surrounding the resolution.

It would seem to me that if there is something that's important and pressing that affects the entire community, that we would want to first discuss that a resolution might be needed, then, if anything, resolve to conduct the proper investigation of that potential resolution before motioning to adopt a new policy.

Furthermore, if there's a motion, I believe it should be well thought out and written prior to a meeting, so it can be documented properly and each member can read the motion and discuss it.
