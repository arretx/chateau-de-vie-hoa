## Landscape Project

While the landscape project is complete and the plants are beginning to mature, sometimes plants do die, especially during the brutal summers we can have here in AZ. Therefore plant replacements will be an ongoing project, and our goal is to stay ahead of any major plant replacements in the future so everything will look colorful and lush throughout the community. 

## Roofing Project

In 2023 we will be finishing the roofing project. As our roofer is addressing each building in order based on the condition of the roof. If you have a satellite dish or antenna on the roof that you are no longer using, please let us know and we will have it removed when the roof is re-coated.

## Block Wall

In 2022, the Board implemented a new policy on installation of block walls to replace the wooden fences. The cost to install the block wall will be the responsibility of the homeowner, and specific design plans must be followed. You can find the complete packet for the block wall specifications on your portal at https://az.portal.ogdenre.com/Home/Login. Your contractor can take this packet to the city to pull a permit to build the wall.

## Water Usage

The community has been experiencing very high water use over the last year and now that we have our irrigation system completely isolated from the water supply to the units, we can conclusively state that the excess water usage is not from the irrigation system. The Association asks that you repair any leaking toilets, believe it or not a leaking toilet flapper can waste 100 to 200 gallons per day. If 10 units have a leaky flapper that is 45,000 gallons per month.
