# Thoughts From a Board Member, Episode 2: Unexpected Property Management Communications

This morning I received a message from Ogden and Company entitled _"Message from Chateau de Vie VI Townhouse Association - Keep Cats Indoors."_  The message was addressed directly to both my personal email address _and_ my board member e-mail address.

As an outsider looking in, I would presume that this message was sent directly to me and that I'm being singled out as the problem concerning cats.  It is not clear from this message that this is a community-wide notice, and in fact, I still don't know if it is.

What is most concerning about this e-mail is that as a board member, I was completely unaware that there was an issue needing attention.  Whatever it may be, at the very least, the board should know when community notices are going out, and why they are going out.

The tone of this message is off-putting.  As a home owner, not a board member, I would read this message, give a proverbial one finger salute to the imaginary forces that drive it, and then ignore it.  

In my experience, I can't recall a message I have received from Ogden, aside from meeting notices, that contained a shred of language that builds relationship.  On the contrary, the correspondence I've received from them tends to be far too direct, sudden and unexpected, borderline nasty, definitely passive aggressive, and generally unpleasant.

I have grown to _never want to see email from Ogden_, no matter who is sending it.

As a home owner, I want connection, community, and relationship with the body of individuals who make decisions about where we live.  Now that I'm a part of that group of people, which is a great privilege, if there is a community problem, I become part of that problem in the eyes of the home owners, whether they know who I am or not.  If there is a community achievement, I become a part of that achievement as well.

Obviously this is a simple e-mail about some sort of issue with pets being outside.  The problem we have is much deeper than this.

From a mechanical point of view, I don't really know if Ogden is doing what they're supposed to be doing because I'm not an expert on that particular topic.  I _can_ express that my experience communicating with Ogden and their representative has been discouraging, and that's enough for me to say...

...Ogden, do better, or we'll find someone who can.

I would like to see an improvevement to the process and toolset by which we notify the community of events, rules, violations, etc., and the verbiage we use in our communications, because these types of e-mails further solidify the unhealthy nature of the relationship the management company has with *_our_* community, and that's a poor reflection on the board.
