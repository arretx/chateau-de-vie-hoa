# Information Technology

We have a need in our community to integrate various internet and computing technologies.  In light of that, a clear path for managing these technologies must be put into place.

I would suggest that step one include reaching out to other associations who have far more advanced demands than we do to learn about the solutions they've implemented.

After identifying the tools that we have, and exploring the tools that we might need, we would develop standards for implementation and management of those tools. We have no I.T. Management role in our board of directors, and I believe that's something that the Association should have.

When it comes to managing computers, computer networks, security systems, access systems, etc., it's important that there be a role, or a set of roles defined.  This may be an actual designation on the board, or a committee, or a third party contractor, as well as users and groups defined in the systems with permissions to access and/or manage the systems.

Given the size of our community and the minimal demands that we have for management of technology, such as cameras, access control systems (pool gate / clubhouse), etc., it doesn't make sense to incur the costs of a third party contractor. Accessing cameras, reviewing footage, programming key fobs and similar functions are quite basic, and could easily be handled in-house.

I would propose that we develop a simple, repeatable, trainable process for handling our current technology demands that we would have complete administrative control over, which we can delegate to a sitting member or members of the board qualified and knowledgable in this area.  Currently, if a third party contractor who has complete control over access to the system and programming of the system becomes unavailable, we are flying blind.

Straight to the point.  Administrative control of the camera and door access systems needs to be held by the Board of Directors, and a clear manual needs to be written on how those systems are to be managed.  At that point, management of that system needs to be delegated to either someone on the board (obviously I'll raise my hand to that since I know the system), or a third party, such as we have now.  However, even if delegated to an outside contractor, **Super Administrative Rights** need to be retained by the Board of Directors in the event that the person managing the systems no longer manages that role.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this topic, and I'm also willing and able to begin developing a plan for this.
